        Saint Nicholas
    </h2>
    <p>Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek Christian bishop of Myra (now Demre) in the region of Lycia in the Roman Empire, today in Turkey. Nicholas was known for his generous gifts to the poor, in particular presenting the
        three impoverished daughters of a pious Christian with dowries so that they would not have to become
        prostitutes. He was very religious from an early age and devoted his life entirely to Christianity. In
        continental Europe (more precisely the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany), he is
        usually portrayed as a bearded bishop in canonical robes.
    </p>
    <p>In 1087, while the Greek Christian inhabitants of Myra were subjugated by the newly arrived Muslim Seljuq
        dynasty, and soon after their Greek Orthodox church had been declared to be in schism by the Catholic church
        (1054 AD), a group of merchants from the Italian city of Bari removed the major bones of Nicholas's skeleton
        from his sarcophagus in the Greek church in Myra. Over the objection of the monks of Myra the sailors took the
        bones of St. Nicholas to Bari, where they are now enshrined in the Basilica di San Nicola. Sailors from Bari
        collected just half of Nicholas' skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the church sarcophagus. These were
        later taken by Venetian sailors during the First Crusade and placed in Venice, where a church to St. Nicholas,
        the patron of sailors, was built on the San Nicol√≤ al Lido. St. Nicholas' vandalized sarcophagus can still be
        seen in the St. Nicholas Church in Myra. This tradition was confirmed in two important scientific investigations
        of the relics in Bari and Venice, which revealed that the relics in the two Italian cities belong to the same
        skeleton. Saint Nicholas was later claimed as a patron saint of many diverse groups, from archers, sailors, and
        children to pawnbrokers. He is also the patron saint of both Amsterdam and Moscow.
    </p>
    <p>During the Middle Ages, often on the evening before his name day of 6 December, children were bestowed gifts in
        his honour. This date was earlier than the original day of gifts for the children, which moved in the course of
        the Reformation and its opposition to the veneration of saints in many countries on 24 and 25 December. The
        custom of gifting to children at Christmas was propagated by Martin Luther as an alternative to the previous
        very popular gift custom on St. Nicholas, to focus the interest of the children to Christ instead of the
        veneration of saints. Martin Luther first suggested the Christkind as the bringer of gifts. But Nicholas
        remained popular as gifts bearer for the people.

    <h2>Father Christmas</h2>
    <p>Father Christmas dates back as far as 16th century in England during the reign of Henry VIII, when he was
        pictured as a large man in green or scarlet robes lined with fur. He typified the spirit of good cheer at
        Christmas, bringing peace, joy, good food and wine and revelry. As England no longer kept the feast day of Saint
        Nicholas on 6 December, the Father Christmas celebration was moved to 25 December to coincide with Christmas
        Day. The Victorian revival of Christmas included Father Christmas as the emblem of good cheer. His physical
        appearance was variable, with one image being John Leech's illustration of the "Ghost of Christmas Present" in
        Charles Dickens's festive story A Christmas Carol (1843), as a great genial man in a green coat lined with fur
        who takes Scrooge through the bustling streets of London on the current Christmas morning, sprinkling the
        essence of Christmas onto the happy populace.
